# Decyphering `sed` expressions is always "fun"…  So to make it easier on the reader here's an explanation:
# tl;dr: Replace last FROM with one that specifies target CPU architecture.
#
# This command replaces the last `FROM` statement in `Dockerfile`, with one that specifies `--platform=`,
#   ex for arm32v7:
#
#   FROM                         alpine:3.10 AS final
#     ⬇                               ⬇           ⬇
#   FROM --platform=linux/arm/v7 alpine:3.10 AS final
#
# Note:
#   `-i` - apply changes in-place (actually change the file)
#   `s/` - substitute; followed by two `|`-separated sections:
#     1st section looks for a match.  Escaped \(\) define a _capture group_
#     2nd section defines replacement.  `\1` is the value of the _capture group_ from the 1st section
